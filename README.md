README
========================

The makefile is for use with ECEN5013 projects that allow users to build for
LINUX(host), BeagleBone Black and FRDM KL25Z. The source directory contains 
a makefile(sources.mk) configured for the sources codes.

all the source codes are put under the "/source" directory;
all the header files are put under the "/header" directory.

#Makefile Features:
* Automatically finds and compiles all source files within the source directory.
* Automatically generates dependecies as files are compiled, ensuring that files are correctly recompiled when dependecies have updated.
* Provide a build report of code size
* Support build for multiple architectures

#Makefile Target
The Makefile provides the following targets to make:
note that When used to cross-compile and build for BeagleBone or FRDM KL25Z, architecture should be specified in the make command:

Build for Beaglebone Black on Host: make ARCH=_BBB

Build for FRDM KL25Z on Host: make ARCH=_FRDM


* make                    -- compile and link
* make build              -- compile and link
* make preprocess         -- generate preprocessed output of all files or individual file (provideing single target name)
* make asm-file           -- generate assembly output of all files or individual file (provideing single target name)
* make compile-all        -- complie only (no linking)
* make upload             -- cross-compile, link and upload the executable file to BeagleBone Black through USB
* make clean              -- remove all output generated by make
* make build-lib          -- generate a library of data.c/memory.c into an archive called libproject1.a
