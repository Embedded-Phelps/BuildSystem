README
========================

The makefile is for use with ECEN5013 projects that allow users to build for
LINUX(host), BeagleBone Black and FRDM KL25Z. The sub-makefile(sources.mk) includes a list of the source files and includes paths that are needed by the build system.

all the source codes are put under the "/source" directory;
all the header files are put under the "/header" directory.

#Makefile Features:
* Automatically finds and compiles all source files within the source directory.
* Provide a build report of code size
* Support build for multiple architectures

#Makefile Target
The Makefile provides the following targets to make:
note that When used on Host machine to cross-compile and build for BeagleBone or FRDM KL25Z, or upload executable, architecture should be specified in the make command:

For Beaglebone Black: ARCH=_BBB

For FRDM KL25Z: ARCH=_FRDM


* make                    -- compile and link
* make build              -- compile and link
* make preprocess         -- generate preprocessed output of all files or individual file (provideing single target name)
* make asm-file           -- generate assembly output of all files or individual file (provideing single target name)
* make compile-all        -- complie only (no linking)
* make upload <ARCH>      -- cross-compile, link and upload the executable file to BeagleBone Black or FRDM KL25Z
* make clean              -- remove all output generated by make
* make build-lib          -- generate a library of data.c/memory.c into an archive called libproject1.a
